//This is the **third website** I built for my portfolio and still consider it not finished. Designed for a Circus Artist where we try to expose her teaching skills and physical abilities for people on demand. This was my **first approach** to AOS animations trying give a deeper and immersive experience for the clients. All of the content was manually developed with HTML, CSS + Bootstrap 5.0 and JS vanilla and was a challenge for myself to prove and implement the knowledge I adquired at that point of my learning process to being a Software Developer. Using "Mobile First" ideas to create this responsive page.
